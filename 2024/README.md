# 2024

This year I was challenged by a colleague to (partially) complete the
first 10 days of AoC using my chosen programming language.

I chose Elixir as I am no longer working with this at my day job, and I have
gotten the itch to get back into it.

I have partially completed all of the 10 first days. Towards the 10th day,
the time that it took to complete each day began to take longer than the time
I had available, but I had a lot of fun!
